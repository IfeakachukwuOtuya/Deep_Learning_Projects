## 📊 Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts customer churn using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. 
It demonstrates a full ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to deployment — with a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

#🚀 Project Overview
  Goal: Predict if a customer will churn based on historical data.

  Dataset: Bank customer churn dataset with features like credit score, age, tenure, balance, etc.

# Tech Stack:

 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)

 Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and an ANN.

 Streamlit for model deployment.

#⚙️ Key Steps
 Data Preprocessing:
  Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
  Feature scaling (StandardScaler).

Model Building:
  Trained multiple supervised learning classifiers and an ANN.
  Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices.

Deployment:
  Integrated models into an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
  Users input customer details, and the model predicts churn risk.
